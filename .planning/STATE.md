# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 10.6.1 — Legacy Editor Removal and Detail Modal Capability Absorption
Plan: 3 of 03
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-26 — Phase 10.6.1 Plan 02 complete

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-22)

**Core value:** 단순한 프리셋과 단계별 카드/시뮬레이션 흐름으로 개인 자산 흐름을 빠르게 이해하고 조정하게 한다.
**Current focus:** Phase 10.6.1 — Legacy editor removal and Financial Detail Modal capability absorption is in progress

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 9 added: Step 1 Financial Settings Input UIUX Rebuild
- Phase 10.5 inserted after Phase 10 (URGENT): Financial Settings UX Integration Repair
- Phase 10.6 inserted after Phase 10.5: Financial Detail Modal Editing UX Repair
- v1.8 shipped: portfolio creation/storage, Step 1 modular and financial setup rebuild, Step 2 strategy comparison redesign.

## Key Decisions

- **AI Removal (D-04)**: 시스템 복잡성 감소 및 정적 웹의 오프라인 안정성을 위해 실험적 AI 기능을 제거하고 코어 엔진 고도화에 집중함.
- **Phase 07 Gap Closure**: Step 1 bootstrap was split into focused vanilla ES module controllers; safe datalist rendering and allocation group open-state regressions are covered by the full Phase 07 Playwright gate.

## Decisions

- [Phase 10]: Step 1.2 household budgeting now uses a compact `신혼부부 예산` summary panel plus a separate draft modal with explicit `예산 저장` / `편집 취소` persistence.
- [Phase 10]: Household context (`single-income` / `dual-income` with optional spouse income) and variable expense `actualSpent` are sanitized at the Step 1 boundary so later phases can reuse the same fields.
- [Phase 08-01]: Step 2 save/list/load/delete now routes through a narrow storage facade; backup behavior remains on IndexedDB-capable paths only.
- [Phase 08-01]: Reset prefers the latest Step 1 source snapshot and falls back to cached original source metadata before returning to an empty draft.
- [Phase 08-01]: Saved Step 2 entries generate a display name from strategy context, horizon, and save timestamp when no existing name is present.
- [Phase 08-02]: Strategy assumptions are centralized in assumptions.js with conservative numeric defaults separated from display ranges.
- [Phase 08-02]: Strategy comparison rows expose signed Won benchmark deltas so underperformance versus Nasdaq or S&P 500 remains visible.
- [Phase 08-03]: Step 2 first-screen order now follows the mobile judgment flow in actual DOM order.
- [Phase 08-03]: DataHub simulation list names and ids are rendered with textContent and dataset while static modal templates remain unchanged.
- [Phase 08-04]: Step 2 runtime market evidence is documented under public/data/indices/*.json, while JEPI/QQQI/DIVO remain editable conservative assumptions in assumptions.js.
- [Phase 08-04]: Loose root QQQ CSV backdata files were deleted after runtime path scanning found no dependency.
- [Phase 09-01]: Account correction now runs at the Step 1 sanitizer boundary so saved, imported, shared, and rendered data use the same repaired account links.
- [Phase 09-01]: Sankey uses a real `total-income` / `총수입` node between individual income sources and account outflows, excluding deficit pseudo-income from total income.
- [Phase 09-02]: Preset setup uses Korean percentage presets (`안정`, `균형`, `성장`, `야수`, `사용자 지정`) and confirms overwrite inside the modal before persistence commit.
- [Phase 09-02]: Korean high-unit money labels stop at one lower unit: `억` displays down to `만`, and `조` displays down to `억`.
- [Phase 09-03]: Step 1 summaryCards now render two financial setup groups and five category cards before Sankey. — Phase 09 requires the default screen to be summary-first while keeping Sankey directly below.
- [Phase 09-03]: Category detail edits stay in financial modal draft state until persistence.commitImmediateInputs() save. — This preserves explicit save/cancel behavior and keeps sanitizer/persistence as the durable boundary.
- [Phase 09-03]: Guided item creation and simple account alias creation live inside the relevant category modal. — The standalone account-management path is rejected for Phase 09; account work belongs inside item flows.
- [Phase 09-04]: Manual Sankey account correction refresh reuses sanitizeInputs()/repairAccountConnections before persistence and rerender. — This keeps D-25 correction behavior aligned with saved/imported/shared Step 1 data.
- [Phase 09-04]: Merged Sankey tooltip metadata remains textContent-based and uses newline-separated rows with CSS pre-line wrapping. — This satisfies D-27 readability without opening an HTML injection surface.
- [Phase 09-05]: Expense/savings/invest detail editing now opens as compact cards and expands only the selected item. — This closes the UAT mobile density issue while preserving explicit save/cancel.
- [Phase 09-05]: Step 1 no longer exposes manual account-transfer settings; item source accounts drive automatic flow balancing. — This removes duplicate cash-flow modeling and keeps surplus/deficit output derived from required item account selections.
- [Phase 10.5-01]: Default Step 1 financial summary now has one static `재무설정 상세` CTA, and summary cards route to the same financial modal controller path.
- [Phase 10.5-01]: Visible Phase 10 couple/household overview UI was removed from the financial modal while sanitizer and household-budget data helpers remain intact.
- [Phase 10.5]: Phase 10.5-03: 월 생활비 uses dedicated variable/fixed sections; variable actual edits stay draft-only until 재무설정 저장. — Plan 03 requires selected variable rows to expose actual controls while fixed expenses remain actual-free.
- [Phase 10.6-01]: Financial modal dirty state now uses full baseline-vs-draft input comparison instead of row selection, modal open, empty add setup, or tab state.
- [Phase 10.6-01]: Variable expense range persists as variable-only `varianceAmount`; fixed rows strip it while existing `actualSpent` compatibility remains.
- [Phase 10.6-02]: Empty inline temporary rows are draft metadata and are filtered from dirty detection/persistence until meaningful values are entered.
- [Phase 10.6-02]: The integrated financial detail modal uses tab-header add actions and guarded pending close prompts while preserving commitImmediateInputs as the persistence boundary.
- [Phase 10.6-03]: Mobile financial rail uses four user-facing cells (수입, 생활비, 투자, 저축), with 저축 combining explicit and automatic savings.
- [Phase 10.6-03]: Legacy modal regression tests now assert Phase 09/10.5 contracts through row-click, inline-add, and in-place apply/cancel semantics.
- [Phase 10.6.1-01]: Income allocation editing now lives inside Financial Detail Modal income row edit state and persists by enabling split income account data when multiple allocations exist.
- [Phase 10.6.1-01]: Savings row additional settings expose item-level annual yield and maturity month while rows without item yield continue to use the global savings yield fallback.
- [Phase 10.6.1-02]: Financial Detail Modal remains the only ordinary Step 1 editor; the auxiliary item-editor controller, hidden legacy panels, global pending bar, and mobile editor FAB were removed. — ADR 0001 and UXR-09 require no second primary financial editor path after Plan 01 absorbed useful capabilities.
- [Phase ?]: 10.6.1-03: List renderer and state helpers were reduced to display-only support now that ordinary editing is modal-only.
- [Phase ?]: 10.6.1-03: Build output is verification-only for this phase; generated version/build artifacts are not committed under the source-first policy.

## Operator Next Steps

- Phase 10.6.1 Plan 02 is complete.
- Next plan candidate is 10.6.1-03 stale renderer/state/style trace cleanup and source-first build verification.
